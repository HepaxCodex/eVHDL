eVHDL
=====

eVHDL is a new tool for developing VHDL code.
The current status of VHDL editors leaves alot
to be desired.  Almost every modern language
(C/C++/C#/VB/PHP/Java/Haskell/Lisp) has a set 
of basic features available in some form of
editor either standalone of in an IDE.

For VHDL this is not necessarily true.

Two tools stand out for VHDL development,
Notepad++ and Emacs.

Notepad++ is great for VHDL but lacks the power to
handle project related concetps (i.e. refactoring).

Emacs is even better, it goes beyond Notepad++ in true
Emacs style.  Way beyond.  Way way beyond.  To the point
whre you have to be an advanced Emacs user who understands
its sytems and the common tools available (like speedbar)
as well as be comfortable using alot of chords.  It
is not at all useful for a beginner.  One must already
be an expert at VHDL and Emacs to really get alot of
benifit from the vhdl modes and associated tools.

Enter eVHDL, and attempt at a VHDL IDE.  Imagine a world
where developing VHDL was just as smooth and sleek
as C# in Visual Studio or Java in Eclipse.  Nice
Syntax Coloring, the ability to tie into your existing
development tool chain (git, svn, Mylyn), electric text,
maybe even style helpers like reSharper.

Currently the plugin is in very early development stage.

Goals:

1) Parse entire VHDL Syntax
2) Electric Text for standard templates
3) Electric Text for Component Instances
